## Overview

This repo contains notebook exercises for a workshop teaching the best practices of using Spark for practicing data scientists in the context of a data scientistâ€™s standard workflow. By leveraging Sparkâ€™s APIs for Python and R to present practical applications, the technology will be much more accessible by decreasing the barrier to entry.

## Materials

There are corresponding videos on Youtube walking through and presenting the materials in here.

> If you find any errors in the code or materials, please open a Github issue in this repository or send an email to inquiries@jonathan.industries

## Skill Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Learn How To
* Use Python for distributed computing
* Scale data processing with Spark
* Conduct exploratory data analysis with PySpark
* Utilize parallel computing with Ray
* Scale machine learning and artificial intelligence applications with Ray

## Who Should Take This Course

This course is a good fit for anyone who needs to improve their fundamental understanding of scalable data processing with Python for use in machine learning or artificial intelligence applications.

## Prerequisites

* A basic understanding of programming in Python (variables, basic control flow, simple scripts).
* Familiarity with the vocabulary of data processing at scale, machine learning (dataset, training set, test set, model), and AI helpful but not required.

## Getting Started

To run locally in a docker container ðŸ‘‡

```
make jupyter
```

or 

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8265:8265 -p 8000:8000 -p 8089:8089 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/ --pull 'always' psychothan/scaling-data-science
```

Then open a web browser to the URL it spits out (the Jupyter server in the container uses [token authentication](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html))

## IPython Console Help

Q: How can I find out all the methods that are available on DataFrame?

- In the IPython console type `sales.[TAB]`

- Autocomplete will show you all the methods that are available.

- To find more information about a specific method, say `.cov` type `help(sales.cov)`

- This will display the API documentation for that method.

## Spark Documentation

Q: How can I find out more about Spark's Python API, MLlib, GraphX,
Spark Streaming, deploying Spark to EC2?

- Go to <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest>

- Navigate using tabs to the following areas in particular.

- Programming Guide > Quick Start, Spark Programming Guide,
  Spark Streaming, DataFrames and SQL, MLlib, GraphX, SparkR.

- Deploying > Overview, Submitting Applications, Spark Standalone,
  YARN, Amazon EC2.

- More > Configuration, Monitoring, Tuning Guide.

### word2Vec

> The word2vec tool takes a text corpus as input and produces the word vectors as output. It first constructs a vocabulary from the training text data and then learns vector representation of words. The resulting word vector file can be used as features in many natural language processing and machine learning applications.
